    <h2>Margin of Safety as the central theme of Investment</h2>
    <p>This safety is not based on what we feel about the investment, since every investor (intelligent or dumb)
      thinks that he has done a good deal and that he is more intelligent than other investors in the market. The safety is rather based on the solid quantitative factors.</p>

    <p>If there is one thing that Graham wishes to be the sole principle to guide the intelligent investors is to maintain a margin of safety. </p>

      <p>The margin of safety for bonds is the haven of govt issues, and high-grade corporate bonds – based on the credit ratings and long-term performance
      The margin of safety for common stocks is based on an earning power considerably above the going rate for bonds. The earning power of a stock is crudely the inverse of the PE ratio (example: a PE ratio of 11 will have an earning power of 9%).
      The margin of safety is the difference between the percentage rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay for it and the rate of interest on bonds (example: with an earning power of 9% and bond interest rate of 4%, the margin of
      safety 5, or more than 100%). During the end phase of bull markets, the earning power reduces, and the bond interest rates increase, so there is no margin of safety.
      The danger to investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more than average risk of diminished earning power. Buying a good quality stock at an
      overvalued price can lead to loss, but on an average more significant losses are realized when inferior grade common stocks are bought at their par value when the market around is performing well. The purchasers of these stocks view the current
      good earnings as equivalent to earning power and assume that prosperity is synonym with safety.
      In order to avoid such scenarios, the financial condition factors (current ratio, interest coverage ratio, P/avg earning) over a long period and especially during the periods of subnormal business.
      The concept of margin of safety is tested especially in growth stocks – the underlying company is performing really well and is generally has considerable growth in EPS in the past – but analysts/investors would not be able to make a
      conservative estimate of its future earnings, since there are so many uncertainties. In addition, the stocks are already famous, so the price has already ballooned in the market. Price is the most important factor that drives the margin of
      safety.
      The margin of safety guarantees that the investor has a better chance for profits than for loss – not that loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain is becomes that the aggregate of the profits will
      exceed the aggregate of the losses. With such an investment policy, a sufficiently low price for a security of mediocre quality can turn into a sound investment opportunity – provided that the buyer is experienced and informed and that he
      practices adequate diversification.
