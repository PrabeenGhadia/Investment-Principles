  <h3>Defensive Investor</h3>
  <p>The defensive investor is unwilling, or unable, to put in the time and effort required to be an enterprising investor. Instead of an active approach the defensive investor seeks a portfolio that requires minimal effort, research, and monitoring.</p>

<div class="Content">
  <p>The quantitative factors which could be analysed by any defensive who is interested to expand his/her knowledge in stock-picking are very simple but strong. A stock should only be picked into the portfolio when all the below factors are being satisfied. The factors are mentioned in the decreasing order of their priority (but nothing should be ignored).</p>

  <p><strong>Strong Financial Condition:</strong> While this might mean a lot to any security analyst, Graham insists on looking into two numbers; Current Ratio should be at least 2; And Long-term debt should not exceed Net current Assets. <br>

    <strong>Earnings growth:</strong> The recent 3-year average of diluted EPS should be at least 1.33 times the 3-year EPS average 10 years back. This is highly conservative, and most of the growth stocks will seem to be performing very well when accessed from this factor
      alone. <br>

    <strong>PE ratio:</strong> Current price should not be more than 15 times the average earning of the past 3 years. <br>

    <strong>Adequate Size:</strong> Defensive investor should only be interested in large and prominent firms, which provide a big margin of safety for him to be at peace without following the market. <br>

    <strong>Earning Stability:</strong> He insists to choose firms which have maintained a stable earning in the last 10 years. <br>

    <strong>Price to Asset ratio:</strong> Price to Book value/share should not cross 1.5. Or, we can use a composite price multiplier that P/E*P/BV should not cross 22.5. <br>

    <strong>Dividend Record:</strong> This factor might not be a strong one nowadays, but the companies who are able to maintain it for periods such as 20 years are to be selected. <br>
