    <p >“To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep
      emotions from corroding
      that framework.” -- <em>Warren Buffett</em></p>

    <p>Investing requires a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding the framework.Speculators depend on technical analysis where they buy when markets are going up and sell when markets are
      going down – however, Graham advises on the exact opposite strategy based on fundamental analysis. One of the long prevailing view of stock market investment is successful investing lies first in the choice of those industries that are most
      likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the most promising companies in these industries.</p>

    <h3>Elements of investing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Thoroughly analyze a company and the soundness of the underlying business</li>
      <li>Deliberately protect yourself against serious losses</li>
      <li>Aspire to adequate and not extraordinary returns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Defensive Investor</h3>
    <p>For a <a href="https://www.arborinvestmentplanner.com/the-defensive-investor-the-intelligent-investor-book-review-chapters-4-5-14/#:~:text=The%20defensive%20investor%20is%20unwilling,effort%2C%20research%2C%20and%20monitoring.">defensive
        investor</a>, one who wants to invest for a longer term and doesn’t want to be bothered by the changes in the market conditions to modify his portfolio, he should have substantial investments in both bonds and equity.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Invest in well-established funds as an alternative to creating own stock portfolio</li>
      <li>Utilize common/mutual trust funds for professional administration of the money</li>
      <li>Dollar-cost averaging which simply means to invest in common stocks in a uniform manner (same amount every month)</li>
    </ol>


    <p>Now, all the above strategies are proven to be successful in the longrun. But, there is one problem here which is that all of them are boring for an investor. the defensive investor can create his own portfolio of stocks following a certain
      amount of <a href="Defensive Investor.html">quantitative analysis</a>, in addition to the qualitative.</p>

    <h3>Enterprising Investor</h3>
    <p>For an entreprising investor, who aims to attain a better than average result, he must follow policies which are inherently sound and promising and but popular on Wall street (since they should have already been reflecting in the market
      prices).<br>
      There are many enterprising investment opportunities in the market which are not in scope for a regular retail investor, since they don’t have the large pockets (handled by institutions and HNIs) needed for realizing a profit from such areas –
      Some of these modes are short selling, arbitrages on currency & merger pricing, and Venture capital investment.
