  <h1>Welcome to the world of Investments</h1>
  <p>“To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding
    that framework.” -- <em>Warren Buffett</em></p>

  <p>Investing requires a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding the framework.Speculators depend on technical analysis where they buy when markets are going up and sell when markets are
    going down – however, Graham advises on the exact opposite strategy based on fundamental analysis. One of the long prevailing view of stock market investment is successful investing lies first in the choice of those industries that are most
    likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the most promising companies in these industries.</p>

  <h3>Elements of investing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Thoroughly analyze a company and the soundness of the underlying business</li>
    <li>Deliberately protect yourself against serious losses</li>
    <li>Aspire to adequate and not extraordinary returns</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Defensive Investor</h3>
  <p>For a <a href="https://www.arborinvestmentplanner.com/the-defensive-investor-the-intelligent-investor-book-review-chapters-4-5-14/#:~:text=The%20defensive%20investor%20is%20unwilling,effort%2C%20research%2C%20and%20monitoring.">defensive
      investor</a>, one who wants to invest for a longer term and doesn’t want to be bothered by the changes in the market conditions to modify his portfolio, he should have substantial investments in both bonds and equity.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Invest in well-established funds as an alternative to creating own stock portfolio</li>
    <li>Utilize common/mutual trust funds for professional administration of the money</li>
    <li>Dollar-cost averaging which simply means to invest in common stocks in a uniform manner (same amount every month)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Now, all the above strategies are proven to be successful in the longrun. But, there is one problem here which is that all of them are boring for an investor. the defensive investor can create his own portfolio of stocks following a certain
    amount of quantitative analysis, in addition to the qualitative. The list of quantitative factors are mentioned below. Note that any stock which satisfies all the below factors will be selected.</p>
