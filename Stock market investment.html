  <h2>The Truth about stock market investment</h2>
  <p>The stock market performance depends on three factors</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real growth of companies – which includes their earnings and dividend yields</li>
    <li>Inflationary growth of the economy during the period</li>
    <li>Speculative growth – which depends on the investing public’s appetite for growth</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But the only absolute truth about stock market forecasts is that they can always be wrong. “Being humble about your forecasting powers will keep you from risking too much on a view of the future that may well turn out to be wrong.The market
    provides us with prices, our job is to decide whether it is to our advantage to act on them. We don’t have to trade with Mr. Market just because he constantly begs you to.</p>
